## Control questions

### 1. What is a low-level language?

A low-level language is a type of programming language that is closely related to machine code, providing little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture. Examples include assembly language and machine code. Low-level languages are often more difficult for humans to read and write compared to high-level languages, but they allow for precise control over hardware and are often used for performance-critical applications.

### 2. Key characteristics of procedural, structured, and imperative languages

#### Procedural Languages:
- **Focus:** Emphasize a sequence of procedural steps or actions to be taken.
- **Functions/Procedures:** Use functions or procedures to organize code.
- **Control Flow:** Rely heavily on loops, conditionals, and sequence of commands.
- **Examples:** C, Pascal, Fortran.

#### Structured Languages:
- **Modularity:** Encourage breaking the program into smaller, reusable modules or functions.
- **Control Structures:** Use structured control flow constructs like loops (`for`, `while`), conditionals (`if`, `else`), and block structures.
- **Reduced GOTO Usage:** Minimize or eliminate the use of `goto` statements to promote readability and maintainability.
- **Examples:** C, Ada, Pascal.

#### Imperative Languages:
- **State and State Changes:** Programs describe a sequence of commands for the computer to perform, often involving changes to the program state.
- **Explicit Instructions:** Provide explicit instructions on how to achieve a goal.
- **Control Flow:** Include loops, conditionals, and variable assignments.
- **Examples:** C, Java, Python (though Python also supports other paradigms like object-oriented and functional programming).

### 3. What is a dynamic library?

A dynamic library, also known as a shared library, is a collection of compiled code that can be loaded and linked to a program at runtime. Dynamic libraries have the extension `.dll` (Dynamic Link Library) on Windows, `.so` (Shared Object) on Unix-like systems, and `.dylib` on macOS. They allow multiple programs to use the same library without duplication, saving memory and disk space.

### 4. What is a static library?

A static library is a collection of compiled code that is linked to a program at compile time, rather than at runtime. Static libraries have the extension `.lib` on Windows and `.a` (Archive) on Unix-like systems. The code from the static library is copied into the executable at compile time, which can result in larger executables but does not require the library to be present at runtime.

### 5. What is a compiler?

A compiler is a software tool that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code, bytecode, or another lower-level language. The resulting code can then be executed by the computer's processor. Compilers perform various optimizations to improve the performance and efficiency of the generated code.

### 6. What is a linker?

A linker is a software tool that takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines them into a single executable or another object file. The linker resolves references between the object files and libraries, ensuring that all symbols are correctly defined and referenced.

### 7. Why do we need `extern "C"` construct in the code?

The `extern "C"` construct is used in C++ to indicate that the enclosed functions or variables should use C linkage. This prevents name mangling, which is the process of encoding additional information (like function parameters) into the names of functions and variables to support function overloading. By using `extern "C"`, C++ functions can be called by C programs or other languages that support C linkage, ensuring compatibility.

### 8. What is a function pointer?

A function pointer is a variable that stores the address of a function. This allows for dynamic invocation of functions, passing functions as arguments, or storing them in data structures. Function pointers are commonly used for callbacks, implementing function tables, or dynamic method dispatch.
